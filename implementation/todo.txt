apply filtering also in time domain -> DONE
	understand why it sounds poor
	check the filter frequency response and compare with spec_env = 1./abs(fftshift(fft(coeffs, nfft)));
		ok, they're the same
	check if both whitening and shaping are done
		whintening is done (called optional spectral flattening), but it's applied to stft of carrier
obtain optimum coefficients also with steep gradient descent -> DONE
perform multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
